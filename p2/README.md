## P1
##Dynamic Web Application, DWA15 class, Project 2
Lindal Gregg Tompkins

This project publishes a dynamic web page based on a cartoon by Randall P. Munroe.  The 
webpage contains a password generator with the option of how many words to include, an 
optional number appended, an optional special character appended, and the option to change
the word seperator.  The webpage is written using HTML5 with bootstrap.js, which adds auto 
refactoring to the page, so it will resize as needed for various devices.
